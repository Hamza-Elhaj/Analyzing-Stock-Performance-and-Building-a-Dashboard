# Analyzing-Stock-Performance-and-Building-a-Dashboard
This project created to analyze stock performance and build a dashboard by extracting information from the web (webscraping).


## Project Overview
For this project, we will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Our job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this project. We will be using Plotly in this course for data visualization.

Stock shares
A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This
entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." [1]

An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases, the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day. The stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges. In this lab, we will use the y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock.
